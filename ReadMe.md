# 🎄 Dream Christmas - FiveM Script

![Dream Christmas](https://i.imgur.com/g0bvsoU.jpeg)

**Dream Christmas** is a festive multiplayer script designed for FiveM servers, bringing the holiday spirit with Snow, Snowballs, Snowman, Christmas trees, presents, and more!

**💸 Price:** We believe Christmas should be free for everyone! No server owner should feel pressured to spend money to bring the holiday cheer to their players. Let’s celebrate this wonderful season together—no excuses, just joy and community spirit! 🎅🎄
